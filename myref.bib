              increasing attacks on the training process. Among them, poisoning
              attacks have become an emerging threat during model training.
              Poisoning attacks have profound impacts on the target models, e.g.,
              making them unable to converge or manipulating their prediction
              results. Moreover, the rapid development of recent distributed
              learning frameworks, especially federated learning, has further
              stimulated the development of poisoning attacks. Defending against
              poisoning attacks is challenging and urgent. However, the
              systematic review from a unified perspective remains blank. This
              survey provides an in-depth and up-to-date overview of poisoning
              attacks and corresponding countermeasures in both centralized and
              federated learning. We firstly categorize attack methods based on
              their goals. Secondly, we offer detailed analysis of the
              differences and connections among the attack techniques.
              Furthermore, we present countermeasures in different learning
              framework and highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Finally
              , we discuss the reasons for the feasibility of poisoning attacks
              and address the potential research directions from attacks and
              defenses perspectives, separately.},

In this paper, we use influence functions — a classic technique from robust statistics — to trace a model’s prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction. To scale up influence functions to modern machine learning settings, we develop a simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down, approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating visually-indistinguishable training-set attacks.}
